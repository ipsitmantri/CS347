# CS 347: Operating Systems
This repository contains my solutions to the **programming assignments** of this course that I took in Spring 2022 at IIT Bombay.  

I took this course to satisfy the requirements for a minor degree in Computer Science. This course was taught by [Prof. Mythili Vutukuru](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/){:target="_blank"}. The course website can be found [here](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/){:target="_blank"}.

## Programming Assignment 1
This [assignment](./Programming Assignment 1/pa1.pdf){:target="_blank"} consists of three parts and deals with the following concepts:
1. Understanding Processes in Linux
2. Working of a Simple Shell
3. Working of System Calls in xv6

## Programming Assignment 2
This [assignment](./Programming Assignment 2/xv6-mem.pdf){:target="_blank"} consists of two parts and is based on understanding memory management in xv6:
1.  Displaying Memory Information
2.  Memory Mapping
    - Implementing demand paging

## Programming Assignment 3
This [assignment](./Programming%20Assignment%203/pthreads-sync.pdf){:target="_blank"} consists of 4 parts, but only the last 2 parts were required to be done. It is based on understanding concurrency and synchronization using semaphores and conditional variables:
1. Implementing semaphore using ```pthreads``` library
2. Using our own problem on concurreny and synchronization, coming up with
    - One correct and one incorrect solution using semaphores
    - One correct and one incorrect solution using conditional variables
